      "review": "I love Bloom & Wild - they have really interesting combinations of flowers and foliage in their bouquets and the fact you can order flowers which will go through the letterbox with Royal Mail makes them ideal for once we're back at work and no longer at home to receive deliveries!  During lockdown I was even sending flowers to myself as a pick-me-up and they are wonderful!  I am a bit sceptical about using the free Royal Mail 24 hour service - when it works it's fantastic, and if it's delayed by 24 hours, most of the flowers do generally recover when you follow the care instructions, but if I am sending flowers for a specific event, I would choose the guaranteed courier!!!  So Royal Mail deliveries are okay for sending to me and keeping costs down, but definitely a courier when I want to make a specific impact!  Thank you guys at B&W for all your lovely deliveries over the last year!!",
