      "review": "I have used Bloom & Wild several times now. The website is clear and detailed. The prices are extremely reasonable. Every recipient has adored the selections and all have said the blooms have lasted at least 8-10 days. The concept of letterbox flowers is genius - meaning you never to have ruin a surprise by warning someone they will be receiving a delivery.",
